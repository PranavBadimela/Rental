              <h6><strong>Create the listing</strong></h6>
              <p>
                Click on the share button in the bottom navigation menu to start
                listing an item. Please fill in item details described in the
                previous section. Once done, you can see your item in ‘my items’
                section of your profile. Search for your item from the search
                field to make sure that your item is available on the platform.
                If there is a problem with the listing or you cannot see your
                item in your ‘my items’ or in search results, please contact the
                administrator.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fake listings or listings with inappropriate and insufficient
                details will be removed immediately.
              </p>

              <h6><strong>Using middlemen</strong></h6>
              <p>
                If you have an expensive item to list and want us to personally
                handle the transaction on your behalf, you can select this
                option during listing the item. If there is no middle man
                available in your area, you have to take care of your entire
                transaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Middleman takes some commission to handle the item. If you don’t
                want to use a middleman, you have to handle the transaction
                yourself.
              </p>

              <h6><strong>TimeSlots</strong></h6>
              <p>
                We have 4 time slots during which a borrower may contact you at
                the item location given by you. You have to select one time slot
                and make yourself available till you handed the item over to the
                borrower.
              </p>

              <h6><strong>Delivering the item</strong></h6>
              <p>
                We will display your item location on the map and give route
                directions to the borrower. On mutually agreed timeslot and date
                (you and borrower), the borrower will come to the item location
                to collect the item. Both of you need to check and agree with
                the item condition, payment terms and exchange the item.
              </p>

              <h6><strong>Get paid</strong></h6>
              <p>
                Borrower pays the money (the rental amount and deposit if any)
                to the platform which we will keep with us till the transaction
                is completed. Once the item is returned and all disputes (if
                any) are resolved, we will pay you after deducting our platform
                fee.
              </p>

              <h6><strong>Connect with borrower</strong></h6>
              <p>
                Borrower will contact you for collecting the item using the map
                directions given by us. It is advised not to make any direct
                deals with the borrower. You can communicate with your borrower
                regarding item condition or negotiate rate or extending
                borrowing period, but always deal through the platform only.
                Else we will not be responsible for any damage to your item.
              </p>

              <h6><strong>Managing the item availability</strong></h6>
              <p>
                You have to make all deals through the platform and tell us
                whenever the item is delivered and returned, so that we can keep
                track of item’s availability show the item to our users when it
                is available and allow them to make bookings.
              </p>

              <h6><strong>Condition of the item</strong></h6>
              <p>
                You and the borrower need to confirm that the condition of the
                item is satisfactory for both of parties, during the delivery
                and return of the item. Platform is not responsible for item’s
                damage or malfunction after the transaction. You and borrower
                need to resolve such issues between yourselves. However, a
                borrower or lender can raise a dispute with us with sufficient
                evidence.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Borrowing item:</strong>borrowing an item is simple,
                    just enter dates for which you need the item, select the
                    time slot during which you want to meet the owner to collect

                  <p>
                    <strong>Paying for the item:</strong>If it’s a paid item,
                    you can pay the amount in the app itself. If it’s a free
                    item, you will get instructions on how to contact the owner.

                    for the item, a map will show you the route to item’s

                    time period during which the owner will be available to
                    handover the item to the renter. The app has 4 time slots, 9

                    (borrower) will see only those time slots during which the
                    owner is available. You have to select one time slot and
                    meet the owner to collect the item you borrowed.
